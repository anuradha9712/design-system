Usage

Color Assignment

The background color of an avatar should be generated dynamically in such a way that at the time of its creation a random color (from the available options) is assigned. Once assigned, the color should stay the same as long as that particular avatar is in use.
For example, an avatar generated for a user - Franklin Clinton, can look like following and it should look the same wherever it is used.

Displaying Name

Since an avatar can either show an image, icon or the initials, there should be an option to show the full name of the entity. This is achieved by hovering over on the avatar to display a tooltip containing the full name.

Square Avatar vs Round Avatar Group

Square avatars and round avatar group are both used to group entities. Square avatar is ideal for presenting a group as a unified entity, while round avatar group facilitates an interactive and visually cohesive representation of individual members within the group.

Fallback Hierarchy

This is the fallback order defined for avatars:

Avoid Square Avatar with Icon Button

It is recommended to not use square avatar in conjunction with an icon button as users may mistake the avatar for a button.

Using PNG and SVG in Avatar

It is recommended to use stone light or a suitable background color that ensures enough contrast between the image and its backdrop when using PNG or SVG formats without a background.

Appending Suffix to the Name of an Entity

In an avatar group, you can add a suffix to an entity's name that appears in tooltips and popovers. 

Note: Adding a suffix for disabled states is recommended to keep users informed.

Presence in Round Avatar

Regular and small round avatars can include presence indicators that visually represent the user’s availability , such as "active" and "away".

Note: Disabled avatars can’t have a presence indicator.

Status in Regular Round Avatar 

Regular round avatars can include status indicators to represent user-defined or system-determined messages, providing context about the user's current activity or situation. A tooltip should be used to define the status.

Note: The status is a customizable slot component that supports replacing it with an image or icon, ensure the icon size is accessible.
